> A mediawiki skin based on Google's Material Design language

This is a project that aims to combine Material Design with MediaWiki to create a new skin. In the visual environment, everything is interactive, showing movement to support the idea that the user is in control. Elements inside it aren't just about the aesthetics, but also about structure and meaning. The interface has colors that convey emotion, typefaces to encourage readability, pictures that are worth a thousand words, and more. 

As its continuously being developed, we keep in mind seven important factors listed below to always create a harmonious experience for the user to engage in. 
- **Accessibility**  
- **Cross-browser support**
- **Cross-device support**
- **Performance**
- **Security**
- **Navigation**
- **Internationalization** (i18n)
